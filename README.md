# PLGA-PEG-MET Nanoparticles
## SYNTHESİS OF PLGA-PEG-MET NANOPARTİCLES
Metformin-loaded PLGA-PEG was synthesized by the double emulsion method (Water/Oil/Water) (1). 200 mg of PLGA-PEG co-polymer was dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane. Second, 20 mg of metformin (MET) was dissolved in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 0.5% w/v) and added to the organic phase. The mixture was emulsified with an ultrasonic probe for 20 minutes. Dichloromethane was removed by rotary evaporator vacuum at 40 °C. PLGA-PEG-MET nanoparticles were deposited by centrifugation at 15,000 rmp.

### CHARACTERİZATİON OF PURE METFORMİN, PLGA-PEG COPOLYMER, AND PLGA-PEG-MET NANOPARTİCLE SYSTEM
The molecular structure of pure metformin, PLGA-PEG polymer and PLGA-PEG-MET nanoparticles was determined by FT-IR (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum BX) analysis. IR spectra of the samples prepared on KBr discs were examined in the region of 4000-400 cm-1.

The sizes of free metformin, PLGA-PEG copolymer and PLGA-PEG-MET nanoparticles were determined by ZetaSizer (Malvern Nano ZS) analysis. The measurement was made with the detector at a 90o angle and the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) model.

The morphology and shape structure of PLGA-PEG-MET nanoparticles were visualized with SEM (COXEM EM-30 Plus). The samples were coated with gold/palladium (Au/Pd).

#### WST-1 CELL VİABİLİTY TEST
Effect of pure metformin, PLGA-PEG copolymer, PLGA-PEG-MET nanoparticles on cell viability (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3 benzene disulfonate ) reagent was used (2). The WST-1 method is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenases into water-soluble formosan crystals. . In this test, 5000 cells were seeded in 100 µl DMEM-F12 medium in a 96-well microplate (3 replicates). The cells were kept in a CO2 incubator for 24 hours to allow them to adhere to the surface. Drugs were given at different concentrations to the control and experimental groups (0.5 mM - 64 mM). 96-well microplates were kept in a CO2 incubator for 72 hours. After incubation, 10 µl of WST-1 reagent was added in a light-free environment and incubated for 3 hours. At the 3rd hour, absorbances (ABS) were recorded at 450 nm wavelength in the plate reader. Additionally, % viability and % cytotoxicity were calculated.

% Viability = (Average Sample ABS/Average Control ABS) x 100
